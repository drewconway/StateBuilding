Purpose:    Code in support of "Network, collective action, and state building"
            
            Code contains two classes: Agent and Environment.
            
            Agent class:        Agent object for computational model described in above paper.
                                Contains fuctionality for forming agent networks,
                            
            Environment class:  Class object to contain agents, and object in which the 
                                computational model is run.  Contains functionality
                                for creating agent networks, adjudicating controbution level,
                                and outputting data from runs.
